# What is it?
This is currently in beta so you may experience some bugs - please feel free to report these in the Issues tab in GitHub. (link within the app in the drop down menu)
It is a GW2 dashboard app which consumes the GW2 APIs in order to display things such as:
* your characters and inventories
* your bank items
* your story progress

# Features available now
* Character view which shows:
   - inventory
   - some basic stats
   - equipment
   - story progress
* Account view which shows:
   - bank
   - wallet
* Map view
   - a GW2 interactive map made using leaflet and the GW2 tile service.
   - can place custom markers on map and rename for remembering some cool locations in Tyria
   - can pan to those marker points by clicking the "show me" button when  you drill into the marker item in the right hand side section
 
# Future Features in the works

* Trading post view
* Display all your dye unlocks
* Mobile optimisation since this is not currently usable and only really works well on larger screens currently.
